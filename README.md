## How to run this project in your system?
Download and extract the zip file.
Open it with any IDE (I used STL).
Go to spring-servlet.xml page and look for the bean named 'ds' (configuring data source)
Change it according to your database requirements.
Create the database with the same name as you put there ('lms' in my case).
After creating the database, come back to the IDE and run project.
It should start and a webpage should open in the browser.
